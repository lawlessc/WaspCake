Where autonomous buzz meets layered abstraction.

WaspCake is an experimental, forward-drifting code construct exploring the delicate balance between precision, emergence, and sweetness at scale. Built as a modular substrate for future-facing innovation, WaspCake exists somewhere between a framework, a concept, and a vibe.

At its core, WaspCake is:

Lightly structured

Deeply extensible

Intentionally undefined

Much like a wasp near a cake, its purpose is suggestive, not prescriptive.

## ✨ Philosophy

Complex behavior can emerge from simple layers.
Some layers sting. Some layers are sweet.
All layers are cake.

## 🧠 Current Status

Early-stage. Pre-alpha. Conceptually unstable.
Interfaces may shift. Meanings may dissolve.
Nothing here is final — everything here is potential.

## 🧩 Possible Directions

Agent-oriented abstractions

Adaptive pipelines

Emergent orchestration

Symbolic automation

Things that probably need better names

(All directions are aspirational.)

## 🚀 Getting Started:

` git clone https://github.com/yourname/waspcake.git `

` cd waspcake `



Then simply observe. Or don’t. Both are valid.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs, issues, ideas, musings, and speculative architectures are welcome. If you feel the buzz, you’re already contributing.
